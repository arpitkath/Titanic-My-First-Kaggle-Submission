# Titanic-My-First-Kaggle-Submission
I have just started using kaggle.<br>
This is my first submission to kaggle.<br>
I have done my best on feature engineering that I can do on this data set.<br>
The accuracy achieved is 0.83 on cross validation and 0.77990 on kaggle.<br>
The model used is SVM with grid search on following parameters {"kernel":['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'], 'degree':[2, 3]}
having cv=5.
